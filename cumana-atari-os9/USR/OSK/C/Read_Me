Herein are the source for the C startup function linked into every Cprogram and an example of the interface to a user trap handler module andlibrary.The cstart.r file is given here as an example of how to interface C programsto the operating system and as a guide for porting C programs to standalonetarget systems.  Note that changes to cstart could affect the proper operationof the C library so changes to standard cstart should be avoided.Files:	READ_ME		This file...	Rels		Directory for object files	cstart.a	Source for the C startup routines	example.c	Example program to access "mytrap" user trap handler and				library.  "make example_trap" makes a version that accesses				the user trap handler.  "make example_notrap" makes a version				that links in the trap handler code from a library.	funcs.c		Functions desired to include in "mytrap" trap handler.	inittrap.a	Initialization to TLink to "mytrap" trap handler on first				call to any function.	makefile	"make" will make "mytrap" and "mytrap.l"	mytraps.a	Code to actually call trap handler module.  Linker references				to "mytrap" functions hook thru these routines via trap calls				to "mytrap" trap handler.	trapdefs.a	"mytrap" trap handler dispatch table offset definitions.	trapmain.a	Mainline code and interface for "mytrap" trap handler.
