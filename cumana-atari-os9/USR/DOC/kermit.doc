A short description of the program options can be obtained by entering:                         kermit -? Two Examples:-------------(1) kermit -l=/t5 -s brief.doc CPROGS/test.c *.h     sends the files "brief.doc",  "CPROGS/test.c"  and all    ".h" files  over the serial interface /t5. Only ASCII    characters will be transmitted.   (2) kermit -l=/t4 -r     receives one or more files over the interface /t4    also in ASCII Mode.  (3) kermit -l=/t5 arc hack -s -i or  kermit -ri -l=/t4     as (1) and (2), but with binary transmission. You may also start a so-called "Remote-KERMIT" on a remote system.You log yourself into the remote system with a communications program(or with "kermit -cl/t5"), and then call KERMIT as follows:(4) kermit -hor  kermit -h -i     starts a Remote Kermit (ASCII or binary transmission).  Following this, exit the Terminal Program.  You can now run remotelythe KERMIT just started.(5) kermit -s -l=/t5 pss.doc pss.help or  kermit -sil=/t5 *.arc     transmits files to the remote computer.  They will be written    to the current data directory.(6)  kermit  -l=/t5  -g  record  "*wolfi"or   kermit -l=/t5 -ig"save/*"      gets files from the remote system.   If Wildcard characters     are used then this parameter must be enclosed in quotes ("). (weo) (Trans. Malcolm Cowen)
