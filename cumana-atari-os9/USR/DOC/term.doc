The entry name, as used byMicroEMACS, is found in the Environment Variable "TERM". If you have enteredthe Editor from the System console (/term), then you must first enter thefollowing command:  setenv TERM st      ;* for monochrome or medium resolution, 25 Rows,                      ;* 80 Columns  setenv TERM st50    ;* for monochrome, 50 Rows, 80 Columns   setenv TERM stlow   ;* for low resolution, 25 Rows, 40 ColumnsYou can also (if you use "login") insert the corresponding command inthe ".login" file in the Home Directory. (see the  OS-9 User's Manual).This command does not work in the "startup" file.(weo)(trans Malcolm Cowen)
