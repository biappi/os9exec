Sub    directories   are  supported  with  either  the  '/'  or  '\'    separator.   The  use  of the '\' separator or wildcards will    require  the  names  to be enclosed in quotes to protect them    from the shell.      tosdel   will  ask  for  verification  prior  to  removing  a    read-only file.      The  environmental  variable  TCWD may be used to establish a    current  working  directory  (relative  to the TOS diskette).    The  environmental  variable TDRV determines the drive number    (0 for /tos0 (default), 1 for tos1).    SEE ALSO      tosdir TOSDEL                     OS-9/68000                        V2.1TOSDIR                     OS-9/68000                        V2.1  NAME       tosdir - display a TOS directory   SYNOPSIS       tosdir [ -w ] tosdirectory     tosdir [ -w ] tosfile [ tosfiles...  ]    DESCRIPTION       tosdir  displays  the  contents  of a TOS formatted diskette.    Sub  directories  are  supported  with  either the '/' or '\'    separator.   The  use  of the '\' separator or wildcards will    require  the  names  to be enclosed in quotes to protect them    from the shell.      tosdir will accept the following command line option:     -w  Wide  output.
