********************************* System Dependent I/O global static storage definitions*   This is a 256 byte common global area which can be used* by system dependent hardware drivers.  The biggest need* for them occurs when a single, write only register is used* by more than one device in the system.  They should be* used sparingly.  References to this area are usually like:* "move.b D_DMAReq(a6),d0".* org D_IOGlobD_DMAReq: do.b 1 DMA request flag do.b 31 reserved for Microware useOEM_Glob equ . end of generic definitions********************************* CPU Specific Definitions org OEM_Glob* CPU specific global variables would be inserted here.  Be careful not* to exceed the limit of 256 bytes (including the 32 bytes reserved for* Microware above).  These values may be read or changed from a user * program (if necessary) with the F$SetSys service request.D_IntSel: do.b 1D_ExpIRQ: do.b 1 expecting interuptD_HdInit: do.b 1 harddisk initialized? alignDMA_Bit: equ 0 DMA in use when setHD_Bit: equ 1 HD requests DMA when setFDIntId: equ 1 floppy IRQ exspectingHDIntId: equ 2 harddisk IRQ exspectingIECIntId: equ 3 IEC IRQ exspectingHDIntId2: equ 4 2nd harddisk IRQ expecting (obsolete)LPIntId: equ 5 Laser printer IRQ expectingNETIntId: equ 6 Network DMA IRQ expectingHdInit: equ 0 harddisk initializedD_MidiStat: do.l 1 MIDI driver static storage address (0 = not valid)D_MidiIRQ: do.l 1 MIDI driver interrupt routineD_VirtGlob: do.l 1 Virtual terminals global storageD_DUART1: do.l 1 DUART 1 status (long)D_PTY: do.l 1 PTY memory base addressD_DUART2: do.l 1 DUART 2 status (long)D_MouseStat: do.l 1 Mouse driver static storageD_MouseIRQ: do.l 1 Mouse driver IRQ routineD_MousePkLen: do.w 1 Mouse status package length for $F6 requests do.b 24 reserved for reccoware use D_VMEST do.b 8 reserved for proVME use* end of file
