The original OS-9 DEFS files are not part of the OS9exec source
due to copyright reasons. The OS9exec project can be compiled only,
if 4 files of an original OS-9 system (V2.4, V2.9 or V3.0) will be
added to this directory:

  - errno.h
  - module.h
  - procid.h
  - sgstat.h
  
Two of these files, "errno.h" and "procid.h" must be adapted.
OS9exec expects them as "errno_adapted.h" and "procid_adapted.h"



"errno_adapted.h"
-----------------

1)  ERRNO_H is in use already, so ERRNO_ADAPTED must be defined instead.

2)  <errno> must be changed to <errno2>, as it clashes with the 
    global <errno> of every compile environment.



           #if !defined(_ERRNO_H)                              
           #define _ERRNO_H                                          

    ===>   #if !defined(_ERRNO_ADAPTED_H)
           #define _ERRNO_ADAPTED_H 



           extern int errno;                                    

    ===>   extern int errno2;




"procid_adapted.h"
------------------

3)  "_except" must be changed to "except", as it clashes with the 
    Windows exception system.


          *_except[10], /* program error exception vectors */  

     ===>  *except[10], /* program error exception vectors */
