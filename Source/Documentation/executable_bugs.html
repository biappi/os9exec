  <h1>Known problems with OS-9 executables and library
  functions</h1>

  <p>This section lists OS-9 executables and library functions that
  are known to fail when run under OS9exec. The problem is
  described and, where known, a work-round is given. Some of the
  problems listed in this section are also potential problems under
  OS-9.</p>

  <h2>Bus errors</h2>

  <p>Some programs cause bus errors due to the way <i>F$Fork</i> is
  called. Shells set the registers up in a standardized way,
  especially the command and environment sections. However, some
  other programs set up the parameters in a slightly different way.
  In particular these don't align parameter addresses on word
  boundaries: this can cause problems when they are run on 68000
  and 68010 CPUs. Some programs have no problems with this, others
  crash.</p>

  <h2>C compiler error</h2>

  <p>The OS9 v2.4 C preprocessor crashes with a bus error if it
  reads a source with UNIX/Linux line terminators. Make sure you
  have the right line terminators before compiling the source
  file.</p>

  <p>Some versions of Kermit, e.g. 8.0.211 for Linux, replace CR
  with LF even during a binary file transfer. This will silently
  modify your source file and cause this problem if you use the
  following sequence of operations to move a source file from an
  OS-9 system into an OS9exec system:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>use <i>kermit</i> to copy a source file from the OS-9
    system into a Linux filing system</li>

    <li>start OS9exec</li>

    <li>use the OS-9 <i>copy</i> utility to move the file into your
    OS9exec filing system</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This sequence is most likely to occur if you don't have the
  ISP package installed in both OS-9 and OS9exec and you are using
  an RBF disk image as your OS9exec filing system. Its easy to see
  if this has happened by using <i>dump</i> to look at the source
  file once it has arrived in the OS9exec filing system. The
  workround is to use <i>autolf</i>, <i>ux2osk</i> or equivalent
  fix the line separators. <i>autolf</i> and <i>ux2osk</i> can be
  downloaded from the <a href="http://os9archive.rtsi.com/">OS9
  Archive</a>.</p>

  <h2>cmp</h2>

  <p>The 3.0 version #23 of <i>cmp</i> has a problem. The V2.4
  version is ok.</p>

  <h2>deldir</h2>

  <p>The original <i>deldir</i> does not work in OS9exec because it
  has a fundamental bug. Install the replacement <i>deldir</i>,
  which is part of the OS9exec release.</p>

  <h2>less</h2>

  <p><i>less</i> version 358 is known to cause bus errors.</p>

  <h2>list</h2>

  <p>The V2.4 version #16 of <i>list</i> causes bus errors. The
  V3.0 version is ok. Install the replacement <i>list</i>, which is
  part of the OS9exec release. This replacement will also compile
  and run under Linux and DOS/Windows (tested with Borland C 4.5).
  It will produce a correctly formatted display from any text files
  that follow OS-9, Linux and DOS/Windows newline conventions.</p>

  <h2>telnetd</h2>

  <p>If no other telnet daemon is active in Linux, OS9exec listens
  on 23 as usual. If the Linux telnetd daemon is active, OS9exec
  will listen on Port 9923. Make sure your firewall is closed for
  ports 23 and 9923 to prevent unauthorised access to OS9exec.</p>

  <h2>Termcap functions</h2>

  <p>The OS-9 <i>tgetent()</i> function is partly broken:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>there's a hardwired termcap definition limit of 1 Kb.</li>

    <li>this limit includes the whitespace at the start of a line
    and the continuation markers at the end. This was proved to be
    the case by successively editing whitespace out of an
    <i>xterm</i> definition. When the definition, including
    whitespace, was reduced below 1024 bytes it was accepted by
    <i>tgetent()</i>. This is a surprising implementation fault:
    the rational assumption is that <i>tgetent()</i> would strip
    whitespace out while loading the definition into the
    buffer.</li>

    <li>if the definition exceeds 1 Kb the message "Termcap entry
    is too big" is output by <i>tgetent()</i> but it still returns
    1, indicating success.</li>

    <li><b>ANY</b> definition in the termcap file that is scanned
    during a search for the required definition causes the message
    "Termcap entry is too big" to be output if it exceeds 1Kb. It
    doesn't matter whether its the definition you were looking for
    or not.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is a documentation deficiency in the Microware Language
  Manual for the <i>tgetstr()</i> function. The manual defines the
  return value correctly as <i>char*</i> but doesn't say what is
  returned if the capability isn't defined in the current terminal
  definition. In fact a NULL pointer is returned and the output
  buffer is not modified. This corresponds to the behaviour
  described in the Linux manpage. If you get this wrong OS-9 may
  trap a bus error and crash your process. OS9exec will certainly
  trap it.</p>
