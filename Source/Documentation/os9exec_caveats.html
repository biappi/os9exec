  <h1>Caveats</h1>

  <p>This section documents places where OS9exec differs from OS-9
  in ways that could affect OS-9 executables and library
  functions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <i>_pmodul</i> field in the OS-9 process descriptor is
    not initialised The only time it is referenced is in the
    <i>F$GPrDsc</i> call, which contains code that looks rather
    like a work-round for it never being initialised. <i>Where
    <b>SHOULD</b> it be initialised?</i></li>
  </ul>
