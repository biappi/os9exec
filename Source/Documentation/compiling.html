  <h1>Compiling</h1>

  <h2>Environment</h2>

  <p>Unlike many packages, the executable isn't built within the
  source tree. Its best to set up your compilation environment by
  creating the directories shown below in the directory where
  you'll be compiling the emulator.</p>

  <p class="c1">os9exec
  <br>
  os9exec/Source
  <br>
  os9exec/Output</p>

  <p>Then change into the <b>os9exec/Source</b> directory and
  run</p>

  <p class="c1">cvs checkout</p>

  <p>to retrieve the OS9exec source tree from SourceForge.
  Subsequent <i>cvs</i> operations should also be done from within
  <b>os9exec/Source</b>.</p>

  <h2>Compilation</h2>

  <p>The following sections describe how to compile OS9exec for
  each of its supported operating systems. The executable is called
  <i>os9App</i> for MacOS9, <i>os9App_univ</i> for MacOSX,
  <i>os9App.exe</i> for Windows or <i>os9linux</i> for Linux.</p>

  <h3>Compiling the Linux version</h3>

  <p>Compile <i>os9linux</i> by changing to the
  <b>os9exec/Source/OS9AppEmu</b> directory and running</p>

  <p class="c1">make -f os9Linux.mk all</p>

  <p>The executable should end up in <b>os9exec/Output</b>. The
  makefile has <i>clean</i> and <i>all</i> as top level targets.
  There are no <i>configure</i> or <i>install</i> targets. The
  makefile is generated by Code Warrior and isn't perfect. It has
  two problems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the dependency tree is broken. A clean build always works
    but there's a good chance that, after a <i>cvs update</i>,
    something that should be rebuilt following a header file change
    won't be built and you'll get spurious errors. It is good
    practise to always do a clean build after a <i>cvs update</i>
    has retrieved updated files.</li>

    <li>Code Warrior creates <i>*.d</i> files for obscure reasons
    of its own. These are also subject to broken dependency tree
    problems, which can cause the compilation to fail with spurious
    errors. <i>make clean</i> doesn't clear out all the <i>*.d</i>
    files, so if the problem remains after a <i>make clean</i> and
    you're sure it isn't your code change that's failing, run

      <p class="c1">find . -name '*.d' -exec rm \{\} \;</p>

      <p>to remove all the <i>*.d</i> files and run a clean
      build:</p><i>make -f os9Linux.mk clean all</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Compiling the Motorola 68000 hardware emulation
  code takes much longer than any of the other modules. Your
  compilation isn't looping: its just thinking hard.</p>
