  <h1>Disk handling</h1>

  <h2>Making and mounting RBF disk images</h2>

  <p>RBF disk images are fixed size binary files that OS9exec
  handles exactly like a physical RBF disk. They are created with
  the <i>crefile</i> utility, which should be installed in
  <b>/dd/CMDS</b>. It is an OS9 executable and run from within
  OS9exec with the <b>-p</b> option. The command:</p>

  <p class="c1">crefile -p xxx 104857600</p>

  <p>will create a file called xxx containing a 100 MB RBF disk
  image. The command:</p>

  <p class="c1">crefile -p xxx 104857600 -d</p>

  <p>will run a bit faster. For disk images larger than 120 MB you
  may need larger sector (<i>-s</i> option) and cluster sizes
  (<i>-c</i> option).</p>

  <p>If the RBF file image is called <b>dd</b> and is in the
  current directory it will be mounted automatically when OS9exec
  is started. Other RBF image files can be mounted by using the
  built-in <i>mount</i> command:</p>

  <table summary="mount commands">
    <tr>
      <td><i>mount xxx</i></td>

      <td>will mount it as <b>/xxx</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>mount xxx /h1</i></td>

      <td>will mount it as <b>/h1</b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>A way of accommodating programs that refer to the RBF image
  <b>/dd</b> as <b>/h0</b> is to mount the image file a second
  time:</p>

  <p class="c1">mount /home/osk/dd /h0</p>

  <p>This will enable the RBF image to be accessed as either
  <b>/dd</b> or as <b>/h0</b>. There are no bad side effects from
  doing this but there is a restriction that prevents more than
  three descriptors being associated with any given RBF image.</p>

  <p>Using <i>chd</i> to change your reference point to a different
  an RBF image file will mount it automatically, using the filename
  as the device name. In both cases the file must be referred to by
  its absolute pathname:</p>

  <p class="c1">chd /home/osk/dd.saved</p>

  <p>will mount the RBF disk image in <b>dd.saved</b> as the
  <b>/dd.saved</b> device.</p>

  <p>The internal command <i>idevs</i> shows the status of mounted
  devices.</p>

  <h2>Native filing system access</h2>

  <p>If <b>dd</b> is a native host directory rather than an RBF
  image file you can read and write to any files in subdirectories
  below it. You can use <i>chd</i> to move round the structure,
  create directories with <i>mkdir</i> and delete directories with
  <i>deldir</i>.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> You must replace the standard OS-9 version of
  <i>deldir</i> with the version supplied as part of the OS9exec
  package before you can delete directories but the standard
  <i>chd</i> and <a>makdir</a> commands work as expected.</p>

  <p>You can <i>chd</i> to any other host directory, create and
  delete directories, and read and write files provided that the
  user running OS9exec has suitable access rights. When changing
  your reference point to another native directory that's outside
  your current directory tree structure you must use an absolute
  pathname.</p>

  <p><i>mount/unmount</i>, which are used to access RBF images
  stored as Linux files, are not needed when accessing the Linux
  file system. Using them this way doesn't cause or report errors:
  it just has no effect.</p>

  <h2>Floppy disk access</h2>

  <p>You can access any floppies from within OS9exec that the host
  system is able to read and write.</p>

  <p><b>Linux users:</b> DOS-formatted floppies which are normally
  readable under OS-9 via the <b>PCFS</b> I/O Manager can be
  accessed. Floppies using OS9 formats cannot usually be accessed
  unless you are using a suitable kernel module, such as <a href=
  "http://www.geocities.com/linuxrbf">LinuxRBF</a>, that
  understands the disk format.</p>

  <p><b>Windows users:</b> DOS-formatted floppies which are
  normally readable under OS-9 via the <b>PCFS</b> I/O Manager can
  be accessed directly with <b>/A/*</b>.</p>

  <p><b>Mac users:</b> DOS-formatted floppies can
  be accessed directly with the floppy device name visible on the Mac's 
  desktop.</p>

  <h2>OS-9 programs that use /h0</h2>

  <p>Some OS-9 programs refer to the default disk as <b>/h0</b>
  rather than conforming to the convention of referring to it as
  <b>/dd</b>.</p>

  <p>A way of accommodating these programs is to create an alias,
  <b>h0</b>, for <b>dd</b> in the same directory. You should be
  aware that this may create security breaches and that it will
  only work if the host operating system supports file and
  directory aliasing. Aliases are known as links in UNIX-like
  operating systems.</p>
