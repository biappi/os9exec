  <h1>Installing</h1>

  <p>The OS9exec emulator is called <i>os9App</i> for MacOS9,
  <i>os9App_univ</i> for MacOSX, <i>os9App.exe</i> for Windows or
  <i>os9linux</i> for Linux.</p>

  <h2>Installation for Linux</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Put the OS9exec program somewhere where it will be in the
    current path.</li>

    <li>Create a base directory.</li>

    <li>The base directory must be either:

      <ul>
        <li>a directory called <b>dd</b> which contains a
        directory, <b>dd/CMDS</b>, that must contain the original
        OS-9 binaries.</li>

        <li>a 1:1 RBF raw image from an original OS-9 system as a
        file called <b>dd</b>.</li>
      </ul>The performance of the RBF emulation is usually better
      and sometimes more compliant for tricky things. Nevertheless
      you can always create an empty RBF Image file and copy files
      into it. Or use the RamDisk <b>/r0</b>, which is also a
      normal RBF RamDisk.
    </li>

    <li>If a file called <i>startup</i> is in <b>dd</b>, it will be
    called at the beginning. Try the existing <b>/dd/startup</b>.
    It might work as it stands, so try it. There is a built-in
    debugger system which you can call with <i>os9linux -d 3
    shell</i> to get more info about what's going on.</li>

    <li>The host's Mac/Windows/Linux directory paths can be
    accessed directly. Relative paths work as expected. Files and
    directories below the <b>dd</b> directory can be referred to as
    <b>/dd/...</b>, but any host's files or directories outside the
    <b>dd</b> directory structure must be referred to by absolute
    name until <i>mount</i> is extended to allow them to be mounted
    as pseudo devices.

      <p>NOTE (for Linux/MacOSX): In the mean time, if you have
      root privileges you can put a symbolic link in the root
      (<b>/</b>) directory that points to the directory you want to
      reference:</p>

      <p class="c1">ln -s /home/osk/fd0 fdx</p>

      <p>allows you the refer to the directory as either
      <b>/home/osk/fd0</b> or as <b>/fdx</b> from inside OS9exec.
      However this is not recommended because of possible security
      breaches.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
