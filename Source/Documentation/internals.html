  <h1>Internals</h1>

  <h2>Booting</h2>

  <p><b>OS9Boot</b> will be loaded at startup if a file with this
  name is available. That means all modules are then visible in
  <i>mdir</i>. For <b>OS9exec V3.33</b> and older versions
  <b>OS9Boot</b> is accessed by name, not via the reference in RBF
  sector 0. From <b>OS9exec V3.34</b> onwards the boot file
  referenced in RBF sector 0 is used. This will be done
  <i>before</i> trying to load a file named <b>OS9Boot</b>.
  Therefore <i>os9gen</i> is supported from OS9exec V3.34 onwards,
  including the <i>extended boot</i> mode <b>-e</b>. The only
  limitation is that the <i>os9gen -r</i> option has no effect, so
  if <b>/dd</b> contains a boot file named <b>OS9Boot</b> it will
  always be loaded.</p>

  <p>If <b>/dd</b> is the host's native filing system
  <b>OS9Boot</b> can, of course, only be loaded by name.</p>

  <p>The module loading sequence during startup is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>the built-in module <i>OS9exec</i> will be linked: This is
    the primary module for process 1 and a placeholder module for
    the internal utilities.</li>

    <li>an <i>init</i> module is first loaded from the OS9MDIR
    folder, if available.</li>

    <li>if (2) failed, <b>/dd/init</b> is loaded.</li>

    <li>for RBF devices the boot file referenced by sector 0 will
    be loaded <i>(OS9exec V3.34 and later)</i>.</li>

    <li>if (3) and (4) failed, an <i>OS9Boot</i> file is loaded
    from the OS9MDIR folder, if available.</li>

    <li>if (5) failed, <b>/dd/OS9Boot</b> is loaded. If it contains
    an <i>init</i> module, this becomes the currently loaded copy
    if its revision number is higher than the current
    <i>init</i>.</li>

    <li>if (6) failed, the OS9exec built-in <i>init</i> is linked
    to ensure that an <i>init</i> module is always available.</li>

    <li>the OS9exec built-in <i>socket</i> module is linked from
    OS9exec.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The effect is that the first copy of <i>init</i> found by
  looking in order at:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>the folder referenced by $OS9MDIR</li>

    <li><b>/dd/init</b></li>

    <li><b>/dd/OS9Boot</b></li>

    <li>the internal <i>init</i></li>
  </ol>

  <p>will be used. All the other modules in <b>/dd/OS9Boot</b> are
  loaded though the kernel, io managers and drivers will not be
  used, except for some descriptor information like the SCSI ID
  from <i>RBF descriptors</i>. Finally the internal <i>socket</i>
  module is loaded for use by TCP/IP connections.</p>

  <p>After this a normal OS-9 startup sequence runs.</p>

  <h2>Bus errors</h2>

  <p>All memory access violations are trapped, so OS9exec should
  never segfault. If an OS-9 process or an OS9exec internal command
  causes a memory access violation it is terminated with an
  E_BUSERR or E_ADRERR error and its state is reported on
  <i>stdout</i>.</p>

  <h2>Debugging</h2>

  <p>Every process writes its debug info to its own <i>stderr</i>.
  If <i>stderr</i> is closed, you'll not see the debug output. If
  you follow the sequence shown below your internal tracing output
  will always be visible:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Decide where the tracing output is to go:

      <p>If you want tracing to appear on your terminal, issue the
      command:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -o 1</p>

      <p>All tracing output will be written to system path 1, which
      is always connected to <i>/term</i> so you should be able to
      see all tracing output on your console. The system path
      number is not the same as a process path number: it is unique
      within the scope of OS9exec. Process path numbers are only
      unique within the scope of a process. You can specify where
      tracing is to go by writing the appropriate command as the
      first line in your startup file or by typing it at a command
      prompt.</p>

      <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you you're trying to trace problems that
      occur before the first shell prompt or login prompt the trace
      initialisation commands must be the first lines in
      <b>/dd/startup</b>.</p>

      <p>If you want to capture the tracing information in a file,
      use the command:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -o /dd/trace.log</p>

      <p>and all debugging output will be written to
      <b>/dd/trace.log</b></p>
    </li>

    <li>Starting and stopping tracing output.

      <p>Output is started by setting (optional the tracing level
      and) the debugging mask:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -d 2</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -d1 2</p>

      <p>The most useful debug flag is bit 1 ( -d 2 ), which shows
      all system call entries and exits: OS9 START is something
      like a "half" system call to the start point of an OS-9
      program. There is a 2nd "half" system call to F$Exit but this
      never returns.</p>

      <p>In the second example the debug level is set to 1
      (detailed) and the mask is set to 2 (dbgSysCall). The debug
      level defaults to zero (normal). It can be set to normal with
      either <b>-d</b> or <b>-d0</b>. There is a separate mask for
      each debug level. Setting the mask at a given debug level
      also sets the masks at all lower debug levels. Masks, whose
      values are bit-significant, can be set by using a decimal or
      hexadecimal value. In the latter case it is prefixed by 0x
      (e.g. 0x2). The internal commands <b>dhelp</b> and <b>idbg
      -dh</b> can be used to display the meanings of the debug
      mask's bits. The command <b>idbg -?</b> lists the arguments
      and options accepted by the <b>idbg</b> command.</p>

      <p>Output is stopped by clearing all debug masks and setting
      the debug level to normal:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -d1 0
      <br>
      idbg -d 0</p>

      <p>Tracing can be started and stopped as many times as you
      want by repeating this sequence.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Selective logging for a specific process id &lt;pid&gt; can
    be done:
      <br>

      <table summary="Writing comments">
        <tr>
          <td><i>idbg -j &lt;pid&gt;</i></td>

          <td>shows just process &lt;pid&gt;</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><i>idbg -w &lt;pid&gt;</i></td>

          <td>shows all but process &lt;pid&gt;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The debugger has a stop mask, set with the <b>-s</b>
      option:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -s 0x0002</p>

      <p>If a traced item's debug mask bit matches one set in the
      stop mask the process is halted and the OS9exec debugger is
      entered in interactive mode. The commands available in this
      mode can be listed by entering <b>?</b>. The <b>D</b> command
      lists the mask bit meanings, <b>G</b> resumes the process
      execution and <b>Q</b> terminates OS9exec.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>It's also possible to halt the current process and enter
      interactive debugger mode if a named file is accessed:</p>

      <p class="c1">idbg -n=filename</p>
    </li>

    <li>Adding comments to the tracing file.

      <p>You can write comments to the debug file with the
      <b>echo</b> command:</p>

      <table summary="Writing comments">
        <tr>
          <td>OS-9 shell:</td>

          <td><i>echo "comment line" &gt;+/dd/trace.log</i></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>EFFO shell:</td>

          <td><i>echo "comment line" &gt;&gt;/dd/trace.log</i></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The tracing file is a normal OS9 text file, so if you want to
  read it outside OS9 you should send it to the host's native
  filing system and convert newlines to match the host convention
  or it may nor be legible. If you've compiled and installed the
  version of <b>list</b> supplied as part of the OS9exec package as
  a utility for your host system, the command:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="c1">list tracefile | less</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>will allow you to display the file without conversion.</p>

  <p>The debugging level is significant if you are tracing i/o
  operations. At normal debug level (0 - default) the system calls
  are traced including all the unsuccessful scans for input while
  the shell is waiting for a command. At detail debug level (1) the
  contents of the read and write buffers are shown in hex and ASCII
  with nonprintable characters in the ASCII representation replaced
  by dots.</p>

  <h2>Drivers, descriptors and file managers</h2>

  <p>All I/O is built-in to OS9exec. No OS-9 drivers or file
  managers are used and most descriptors are ignored. One exception
  is that when a SCSI disk is accessed, its ID is taken
  from the corresponding RBF descriptor. The default RAM disk
  size will be read from its descriptor as well.</p>

  <h2>Environment variables</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>OS9CMDS</dt>

    <dd>usually defined as <i>$OS9DISK/CMDS</i>, it sets OS9exec's
    default execution directory, so should be defined after
    OS9DISK. It is mainly useful where a startup file isn't being
    used.</dd>

    <dt>OS9DISK</dt>

    <dd>names the OS9exec default disk, which can be an RBF image
    file or the host's native filing system</dd>

    <dt>OS9MDIR</dt>

    <dd>names a directory from where modules can be loaded at boot
    time. By default it's a directory called OS9MDIR in the same
    folder as <b>dd</b>. The idea is that you just can link to
    modules without loading them. At the beginning of the OS9exec
    project <i>init</i>, <i>cio</i>, <i>math</i> and <i>shell</i>
    had to be there to allow a consistent startup from a physical
    hard disk. Now OS9exec can boot from an RBF disk image or a
    host's native filing system without needing the special module
    directory. The contents of OS9MDIR must be linked by commands
    in <b>/dd/startup</b> to load them before you can see them in
    the <i>mdir</i> display.</dd>

    <dt>OS9PATH</dt>

    <dd>usually defined as <i>.:$OS9DISK:$OS9CMDS:</i>, it sets up
    the OS9exec default search path, so should be defined after
    OS9CMDS. It is mainly useful where a startup file isn't being
    used.</dd>

    <dt>OS9STOP</dt>

    <dd>allows the internal <i>stop</i> or <i>shutdown</i> command
    to be executed by any OS-9 user. If OS9STOP isn't defined these
    commands can only be executed by the super user.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Graphics</h2>

  <p>Graphics is supported (on X11 for Linux and MacOS / on MGP for
  Windows) if the original MGR from Reccoware is installed.</p>

  <h2>Internal commands</h2>

  <p>A command <i>ihelp</i> or <i>icmds</i> lists the available
  built-in commands. These are either replacements of the standard
  OS-9 commands or do things for which OS-9 has no equivalent.</p>

  <p>You can use the built-in <i>mount</i> command to create RAM
  disks and to connect to RBF images with arbitrary Linux
  filenames. <i>mount -?</i> gives more info.</p>

  <h2>Linking/loading modules</h2>

  <p>If <i>F$Load</i> is called, the module is always loaded from a
  file. This is the same for both OS-9 and OS9exec. That's because
  the module name could differ from the file name.</p>

  <p><i>F$Link</i> should check if the module is already in the
  in-memory module chain. If it is, the link count is incremented.
  Otherwise OS9exec will attempt to load the module from a file of
  the same name.</p>

  <h2>Logins</h2>

  <p>OS9exec's login should behave the same as OS-9, but it will
  always login via <i>/term</i>, which maps onto the <i>stdin</i>,
  <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> paths inherited by
  <i>os9linux</i>. <i>/term</i> is written in a very
  straight-forward approach.</p>

  <p>If you have the Reccoware MGR package installed it can use an
  X-terminal window with all the termcap features supported as
  usual.</p>

  <p>Another possibility is to login via MGR with a telnet client
  from within your preferred terminal emulator. Of course you need
  Microware's <i>telnetd</i>, which is supplied as part of the ISP
  package, for that.</p>

  <h2>Memory access</h2>

  <p>OS9exec uses simple <i>malloc()</i> calls, so it will get as
  much memory as it requires. If however <i>F$SRqMem</i> passes an
  incredible amount of memory to be requested, you can get a
  segfault. The UAE, OS9exec's built-in 68000 emulator, directly
  accesses this memory. That means it's quite easy to create
  segfaults, which will be trapped and reported by OS9exec as a bus
  error, when an OS-9 system would only give a bus error if a
  hardware MMU was installed. As a result, OS9exec will intercept
  and report memory access violations that would go un-noticed
  under OS-9.</p>

  <p>Each <i>F$SRqMem</i> request causes a separate <i>malloc()</i>
  to be executed by the host OS. In consequence the emulator's
  memory map is fragmented in exactly the same way as occurs in a
  real OS-9 system. When a process terminates, the memory fragments
  are released by calls to the host OS <i>free()</i> function. The
  only consequence is that, unlike a real OS-9 system, the emulator
  should never die due to excessive memory fragmentation provided
  that the host OS is capable of coalescing the released fragments
  back into a single unused memory pool.</p>

  <h2>Networking</h2>

  <p>Networking over TCP/IP is supported if Microware's original
  Internet Support Package (ISP) is installed.</p>

  <p>All network access code is in <b>OS9exec_core/network.c</b>.
  Comments give the <i>getstt/setstt</i> sequences needed for some
  of the operations, but not close, which crashes. This crash
  happens regardless of which end closes the connection: its an
  unsolved bug.</p>

  <p>The system can be used as multiple listener, so multiple
  telnet sessions can be opened in parallel. There are up to 100
  tty/pty pairs. Usually the system opens one. If it's taken
  already, you'll get a E_DEVBSY. Repeating the attempt to open a
  tty/pty pair should ask for the next one.</p>

  <h2>Printing</h2>

  <p>Printing is supported for the Windows version.</p>

  <p>The MacOS and Linux versions of OS9exec currently have no
  printer support.</p>
